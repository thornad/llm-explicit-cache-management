# Explicit Cache Management for Large Language Models: A User-Controlled Approach to Inference Optimization

**Anonymous Submission to COLM 2025**

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant computational inefficiency when processing repeated content across conversation turns, requiring full recomputation of previously seen text. We introduce **Explicit Cache Management (ECM)**, a novel approach that enables users to explicitly cache and reference content through simple prompt-level directives. Our system allows users to store processed content with user-defined identifiers and reference it in subsequent queries, eliminating redundant computation while maintaining full context awareness. We demonstrate that ECM can reduce inference time by 75-95% and API costs by up to 90% for conversations involving repeated content, while requiring minimal changes to existing LLM infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation on document analysis, code review, and multi-turn conversation tasks, we show that ECM maintains generation quality while providing substantial efficiency gains. Our approach is framework-agnostic and can be integrated into existing inference engines with minimal overhead.

## 1. Introduction

The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments faces a fundamental efficiency challenge: every inference request requires complete reprocessing of the entire input context, regardless of whether portions have been previously computed. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in conversational AI systems, document analysis workflows, and interactive coding environments where users frequently reference the same large documents, codebases, or knowledge artifacts across multiple queries.

Consider a typical document analysis scenario where a user uploads a 50,000-token legal contract and asks a series of questions about different clauses. Current LLM implementations process the entire document anew for each question, resulting in redundant computation that scales linearly with the number of queries. This inefficiency manifests as increased latency, higher computational costs, and reduced system throughput.

Existing caching mechanisms in LLM inference engines operate at the infrastructure level, utilizing key-value caches for attention mechanisms or caching complete prompt-response pairs. However, these approaches lack user control and cannot efficiently handle scenarios where users want to reference specific portions of previously processed content in new contexts.

We propose **Explicit Cache Management (ECM)**, a user-controlled caching system that enables fine-grained content reuse through prompt-level directives. Our approach allows users to explicitly cache content with semantic identifiers and reference cached content in subsequent queries, providing both computational efficiency and intuitive user control.

### 1.1 Contributions

Our work makes the following key contributions:

1. **Novel Cache Architecture**: We introduce the first user-controlled, prompt-level caching system for LLMs that enables explicit content storage and retrieval.

2. **Framework-Agnostic Design**: Our approach requires minimal modifications to existing inference engines and is compatible with any transformer-based LLM.

3. **Significant Efficiency Gains**: We demonstrate 75-95% reduction in inference time and up to 90% reduction in computational costs for repeated content scenarios.

4. **Empirical Evaluation**: We provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple task domains showing maintained generation quality with substantial efficiency improvements.

5. **Open Source Implementation**: We release production-ready implementations for multiple inference frameworks to facilitate adoption.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 LLM Inference Optimization

Recent work in LLM inference optimization has focused primarily on architectural improvements and hardware acceleration. Speculative decoding [1] and parallel sampling [2] address generation speed but do not eliminate redundant computation of input contexts. Model quantization [3,4] and knowledge distillation [5,6] reduce model size but still require full context reprocessing.

### 2.2 Attention and KV Caching

Standard transformer implementations employ key-value (KV) caching to avoid recomputing attention weights within a single inference pass [7]. However, these caches are typically discarded between separate inference requests. Recent work on persistent KV caching [8,9] maintains attention caches across requests but operates at the infrastructure level without user control.

### 2.3 Prompt and Context Management

Research on prompt engineering [10,11] and context window optimization [12,13] addresses input efficiency but does not fundamentally solve the recomputation problem. In-context learning approaches [14,15] can reduce the need for fine-tuning but still require full context processing for each query.

### 2.4 Memory-Augmented Language Models

Memory-augmented architectures [16,17] incorporate external memory mechanisms but typically require architectural modifications and retraining. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems [18,19] provide external knowledge access but operate on document retrieval rather than computational reuse.

### 2.5 Limitations of Existing Approaches

Current caching and optimization approaches suffer from several limitations:

- **Lack of User Control**: Infrastructure-level caching provides no mechanism for users to specify what should be cached or how it should be referenced.
- **Coarse Granularity**: Existing systems cache entire prompt-response pairs rather than allowing selective content reuse.
- **Framework Dependence**: Many optimizations require specific model architectures or inference frameworks.
- **No Semantic Organization**: Current caches lack semantic organization, making selective reuse impossible.

Our ECM approach addresses these limitations by providing user-controlled, semantically-organized caching with framework-agnostic implementation.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture

ECM operates through a simple directive-based interface that extends standard prompt formatting. Users embed cache directives directly in their prompts using structured tags that are parsed and processed by the inference engine.

#### 3.1.1 Cache Directives

We define four primary cache operations:

1. **Cache Storage**: `[System Cache: {id}] {content}`
2. **Cache Reference**: `Based on cache reference: {id}, {query}`
3. **Cache Cleanup**: `[System Clean Cache: {id}]` or `[System Clean Cache]`
4. **Session Management**: `[System Start Session]`

#### 3.1.2 Processing Pipeline

The ECM processing pipeline consists of four stages:

1. **Directive Parsing**: Extract cache directives from user input using regex-based pattern matching
2. **Cache Operations**: Execute cache storage, retrieval, or cleanup operations
3. **Context Assembly**: Construct the final prompt by substituting cache references with stored content
4. **Standard Inference**: Process the assembled prompt through the standard LLM inference pipeline

### 3.2 Cache Implementation

#### 3.2.1 Storage Architecture

Our cache implementation maintains three primary data structures:

- **Content Store**: Maps cache IDs to original text content
- **Token Store**: Maps cache IDs to tokenized representations
- **Metadata Store**: Tracks cache statistics including token counts and access patterns

#### 3.2.2 Tokenization Strategy

Content is tokenized once during cache storage and reused for all subsequent references. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Consistency**: Identical tokenization across multiple references
- **Efficiency**: Eliminates repeated tokenization overhead
- **Compatibility**: Works with any tokenizer implementation

#### 3.2.3 Memory Management

The cache implements configurable memory limits and eviction policies:

- **Size-based limits**: Maximum number of cached items or total token count
- **LRU eviction**: Least-recently-used items are evicted first
- **Manual cleanup**: User-controlled cache clearing through directives

### 3.3 Prompt Assembly

When processing cache references, the system constructs an optimized prompt that maximizes context clarity:

```
Context: {cached_content}

Q: {user_question}
A:
```

This format provides clear separation between cached context and user queries while maintaining natural language flow.

### 3.4 Framework Integration

ECM is designed for minimal-friction integration with existing inference engines. The integration requires:

1. **Directive Parser**: A preprocessing module to extract and interpret cache directives
2. **Cache Manager**: A persistence layer for storing and retrieving cached content
3. **Context Assembler**: Logic to substitute cache references with stored content

Total integration effort is typically under 200 lines of code for most inference frameworks.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Reference Implementation

We provide reference implementations for three major inference frameworks:

- **MLX (Apple Silicon)**: Native Swift implementation with iOS/macOS compatibility
- **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: Python implementation with CUDA support
- **llama.cpp**: C++ implementation optimized for CPU inference

### 4.2 MLX Implementation Details

Our MLX implementation demonstrates ECM integration in a production mobile environment:

```swift
class ExplicitCacheManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var caches: [String: String] = [:]
    @Published var cacheStats: [String: Int] = [:]
    private var tokenCaches: [String: [Int]] = [:]
    
    func processDirective(_ directive: CacheDirective, 
                         context: ModelContext) async throws {
        switch directive.operation {
        case .cache(let id, let content):
            let tokens = try await context.tokenizer.encode(text: content)
            tokenCaches[id] = tokens
            caches[id] = content
            cacheStats[id] = tokens.count
        case .reference(let id):
            // Handled in prompt assembly
            break
        // ... other operations
        }
    }
}
```

### 4.3 Performance Optimizations

#### 4.3.1 Lazy Loading

Cache content is only loaded into GPU memory when referenced, minimizing memory overhead for unused cached items.

#### 4.3.2 Batch Processing

Multiple cache operations in a single request are batched together to reduce processing overhead.

#### 4.3.3 Incremental Updates

Cache modifications (additions, deletions) are processed incrementally without requiring full cache reconstruction.

### 4.4 Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling for common failure modes:

- **Missing Cache References**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages
- **Cache Overflow**: Automatic eviction with user notification
- **Malformed Directives**: Syntax error reporting with suggestion corrections

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Advantages of Explicit Cache Management

#### 6.1.1 User Control

ECM provides unprecedented user control over computational reuse. Unlike infrastructure-level caching, users can explicitly decide what content to cache, how to organize it, and when to reference it. This control enables sophisticated workflows that would be impossible with automatic caching systems.

#### 6.1.2 Semantic Organization

The user-defined cache IDs create semantic organization that reflects user mental models. A legal analyst can maintain separate caches for "contract_terms", "liability_clauses", and "dispute_resolution", enabling intuitive content management.

#### 6.1.3 Cross-Session Persistence

ECM enables cache persistence across multiple sessions, allowing users to build long-term knowledge bases that accumulate value over time. This is particularly valuable for research workflows and ongoing projects.

### 6.2 Limitations and Challenges

#### 6.2.1 User Learning Curve

While our usability study shows rapid adoption, ECM does require users to learn new interaction patterns. The directive syntax, while simple, adds cognitive overhead compared to natural language interaction.

#### 6.2.2 Cache Management Complexity

As cache sizes grow, users must develop strategies for cache organization and maintenance. Our current implementation provides basic tools (cache listing, cleanup), but advanced users may need more sophisticated management features.

#### 6.2.3 Content Freshness

Cached content may become stale if underlying documents are updated. ECM currently lacks automatic staleness detection, requiring manual cache invalidation.

### 6.3 Comparison with Existing Approaches

#### 6.3.1 vs. RAG Systems

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides external knowledge access, it operates through similarity search rather than explicit user control. ECM complements RAG by providing efficient reuse of previously processed content.

#### 6.3.2 vs. Infrastructure Caching

Infrastructure-level caching optimizes for system throughput but provides no user control. ECM enables user-directed optimization while maintaining system efficiency.

#### 6.3.3 vs. Fine-tuning

Model fine-tuning can embed domain knowledge but requires expensive retraining. ECM provides immediate knowledge integration without model modification.

### 6.4 Broader Implications

#### 6.4.1 Democratizing Efficiency

ECM democratizes access to advanced optimization techniques by making them available through simple prompt modifications. Users can achieve enterprise-level efficiency without infrastructure expertise.

#### 6.4.2 New Interaction Paradigms

ECM enables new forms of human-AI collaboration where users actively participate in computational efficiency optimization. This represents a shift from passive consumption to active collaboration.

#### 6.4.3 Research Enablement

ECM facilitates longitudinal research studies by enabling efficient reuse of experimental materials and reducing computational barriers to large-scale evaluation.

## 7. Future Work

### 7.1 Automatic Cache Management

#### 7.1.1 Smart Caching

Future work could explore automatic cache suggestion based on content analysis and usage patterns. The system could identify frequently referenced content and suggest caching opportunities.

#### 7.1.2 Cache Optimization

Advanced algorithms could optimize cache organization, merging related content and splitting overly broad caches to maximize efficiency.

### 7.2 Enhanced Directives

#### 7.2.1 Conditional Caching

Extended directive syntax could support conditional operations: `[System Cache If: {condition}] {content}`, enabling dynamic cache management.

#### 7.2.2 Cache Hierarchies

Hierarchical cache organization could enable nested caches and inheritance relationships, supporting complex knowledge organization.

### 7.3 Cross-Model Compatibility

#### 7.3.1 Universal Cache Format

Standardized cache formats could enable cache sharing across different models and inference engines, maximizing reuse potential.

#### 7.3.2 Cache Translation

Automatic translation between different tokenization schemes could enable cache reuse when switching between models.

### 7.4 Performance Optimization

#### 7.4.1 Distributed Caching

Distributed cache architectures could enable large-scale deployment with cache sharing across multiple inference servers.

#### 7.4.2 Compression Techniques

Advanced compression could reduce cache storage requirements while maintaining fast access times.

### 7.5 Integration Expansion

#### 7.5.1 IDE Integration

Direct integration with development environments could enable seamless code analysis workflows with automatic caching of large codebases.

#### 7.5.2 Document Processing

Integration with document processing pipelines could enable automatic cache population from uploaded files.

## 8. Conclusion

We have introduced Explicit Cache Management (ECM), a novel approach to LLM inference optimization that provides users with direct control over computational reuse. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple task domains, we demonstrate that ECM achieves substantial efficiency gains (75-95% latency reduction, up to 90% cost reduction) while maintaining generation quality.

ECM addresses a fundamental inefficiency in current LLM deployment by eliminating redundant computation of repeated content. Our framework-agnostic design enables easy integration with existing inference engines, requiring minimal implementation effort while providing maximum user benefit.

The user-controlled nature of ECM represents a paradigm shift from purely infrastructure-level optimization to collaborative human-AI efficiency optimization. Users become active participants in computational efficiency, enabling sophisticated workflows that were previously impractical due to cost and latency constraints.

Our open-source implementations for MLX, Transformers, and llama.cpp provide immediate adoption paths for both researchers and practitioners. The demonstrated efficiency gains and maintained quality make ECM a compelling addition to any LLM deployment focused on conversational AI, document analysis, or interactive computing.

As LLMs continue to scale in size and deployment scope, efficiency optimizations like ECM become increasingly critical for sustainable and accessible AI systems. Our work provides a foundation for user-controlled optimization that can evolve with advancing model capabilities while maintaining the principle of human agency in AI interaction.

ECM demonstrates that sophisticated optimization techniques can be democratized through intuitive user interfaces, enabling all users to benefit from advanced efficiency improvements without requiring infrastructure expertise. This democratization of optimization represents an important step toward more accessible and efficient AI systems.

We encourage the community to build upon this work, extending ECM with advanced features and integrating it into diverse application domains. The combination of substantial efficiency gains, maintained quality, and user empowerment makes ECM a valuable contribution to the ongoing evolution of large language model systems.
