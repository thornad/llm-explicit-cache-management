# LLM Explicit Cache Management: Use Cases and Examples

This document provides comprehensive examples of how explicit cache management can be applied across different application scenarios.

## Use Case 1: Document Q&A Chatbot

**Scenario**: A legal document analysis chatbot where users upload contracts and ask multiple questions.

### Implementation

```javascript
// Session initialization
"[System Start Session]"

// Cache the legal document once
"[System Cache: contract_2024] Here is the employment contract: 

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This Employment Agreement ('Agreement') is entered into on [DATE] between 
TechCorp Inc. ('Company') and John Smith ('Employee').

SECTION 1: POSITION AND DUTIES
Employee shall serve as Senior Software Engineer...

SECTION 2: COMPENSATION  
Base salary: $120,000 annually...

SECTION 3: BENEFITS
- Health insurance coverage
- 401(k) matching up to 6%
- 4 weeks paid vacation...

[... 45KB more contract text ...]"

// Multiple queries efficiently reuse the cached document
"[System Cache Reference: contract_2024] What is the base salary mentioned in this contract?"

"[System Cache Reference: contract_2024] What benefits are provided to the employee?"

"[System Cache Reference: contract_2024] What are the termination conditions?"

"[System Cache Reference: contract_2024] Does this contract include a non-compete clause?"

// Clean up when conversation ends
"[System Clean Cache: contract_2024]"
```

### Performance Comparison Summary

### Bandwidth and Cost Savings Across Use Cases

| Use Case | Document Size | Queries | Without Caching | With Caching | Savings |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Legal Document Q&A | 50KB | 5 | 250KB transferred | 58KB transferred | 77% |
| Multi-Document Analysis | 3×30KB | 8 | 720KB transferred | 98KB transferred | 86% |
| Code Review | 60KB total | 12 | 720KB transferred | 84KB transferred | 88% |
| Mobile Legal App | 40KB | 4 | 160KB transferred | 46KB transferred | 71% |
| Customer Support | 80KB total | 6 | 480KB transferred | 92KB transferred | 81% |
| Academic Research | 150KB total | 10 | 1.5MB transferred | 170KB transferred | 89% |

### Response Time Improvements

- **First query**: Slower (cache creation overhead)
- **Subsequent queries**: 2-5x faster (KV cache reuse)
- **Mobile devices**: 3-7x faster (limited compute resources)
- **Long documents**: Up to 10x faster (linear scaling with document size)

### Memory Usage Patterns

- **Server deployment**: Linear growth with cached content size
- **Mobile deployment**: Configurable limits with LRU eviction
- **Multi-session**: Isolated memory pools prevent interference
- **Cleanup**: Deterministic memory reclamation

## Best Practices and Patterns

### 1. Session Management
```javascript
// Always start with session initialization
"[System Start Session]"

// Use explicit session IDs for debugging
"[System Start Session: user_123_session_456]"

// Clean up at session end
"[System Clean Cache]"
```

### 2. Memory-Conscious Caching
```javascript
// Use TTL for temporary content
"[System Cache: temp_doc, ttl: 3600] [LARGE TEMPORARY DOCUMENT]"

// Set priorities for important content
"[System Cache: critical_doc, priority: high] [IMPORTANT DOCUMENT]"

// Clean up selectively
"[System Clean Cache: temp_doc,old_doc]"  // Remove specific caches
```

### 3. Mobile Optimization
```javascript
// Cache user context with long TTL
"[System Cache: user_context, ttl: 86400] [USER PREFERENCES]"

// Cache documents with shorter TTL
"[System Cache: current_doc, ttl: 1800] [DOCUMENT]"

// Monitor memory usage
"[System Cache Stats]"  // Check memory usage regularly
```

### 4. Multi-Document Workflows
```javascript
// Cache documents with descriptive IDs
"[System Cache: legal_contract] [CONTRACT TEXT]"
"[System Cache: company_policy] [POLICY TEXT]"
"[System Cache: meeting_notes] [NOTES TEXT]"

// Use strategic combinations
"[System Cache Reference: legal_contract,company_policy] Are these aligned?"
"[System Cache Reference: meeting_notes] What decisions were made?"
```

### 5. Error Handling and Fallbacks
```javascript
// Graceful degradation for unsupported systems
function sendMessage(message, cacheEnabled = true) {
    if (cacheEnabled && systemSupportsCache()) {
        return sendWithCache(message);
    } else {
        // Fallback to traditional approach
        return sendTraditional(expandAllReferences(message));
    }
}
```

## Implementation Tips

### For Inference Engine Developers

1. **Parse Early**: Process cache commands before tokenization
2. **Store Efficiently**: Keep both raw content and computed KV states
3. **Isolate Sessions**: Prevent cache leakage between users
4. **Monitor Memory**: Implement configurable limits and eviction
5. **Optimize Mobile**: Special handling for resource-constrained devices

### For Application Developers

1. **Plan Cache Strategy**: Decide what to cache and for how long
2. **Use Descriptive IDs**: Make cache references clear and meaningful
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track cache hit rates and memory usage
4. **Handle Errors**: Gracefully degrade when caching fails
5. **Test Across Devices**: Verify performance on different hardware

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Cache Everything**: Only cache content that will be reused
2. **Ignore Memory Limits**: Always implement reasonable bounds
3. **Skip Session Cleanup**: Clean up caches to prevent memory leaks
4. **Forget Mobile Constraints**: Test on resource-limited devices
5. **Assume Support**: Always have fallbacks for unsupported systems

## Future Use Cases

As the specification evolves, we anticipate new use cases:

### Cross-Session Sharing
```javascript
// Share common knowledge across users (future extension)
"[System Cache: shared_knowledge, scope: global] [COMMON REFERENCE MATERIAL]"
```

### Intelligent Caching
```javascript
// AI-driven cache recommendations (future extension)  
"[System Cache: doc1, auto-evict: smart] [DOCUMENT]"
```

### Distributed Caching
```javascript
// Multi-node cache coordination (future extension)
"[System Cache: doc1, replicate: 3] [DOCUMENT]"
```

**Without caching:**
- Document size: 50KB (≈12,800 tokens)
- 5 queries × 50KB = 250KB total transfer
- 5 × 12,800 = 64,000 tokens processed
- Cost: 64,000 tokens × $0.03/1K = $1.92

**With explicit caching:**
- Initial cache: 50KB (12,800 tokens)
- 4 queries: ~2KB each (≈500 tokens each)
- Total: 50KB + 8KB = 58KB transfer
- Tokens: 12,800 + 2,000 = 14,800 tokens
- Cost: 14,800 tokens × $0.03/1K = $0.44

**Savings**: 77% cost reduction, 77% bandwidth reduction, 2-5x faster responses

## Use Case 2: Multi-Document Comparative Analysis

**Scenario**: Financial analyst comparing quarterly reports from multiple companies.

### Implementation

```javascript
"[System Start Session]"

// Cache multiple financial documents
"[System Cache: company_a_q3] COMPANY A - Q3 2024 EARNINGS REPORT

        this.cache.set(user.id, user);
        return user;
    }
    
    [... 25KB more code ...]"

"[System Cache: test_code] // Test suite
describe('UserService', () => {
